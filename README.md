### Why?

We are just having fun with [Nicolas](https://github.com/meienberger) learning new languages and we thing Go is a better option for our CLI.

## Features

The Runtipi Go CLI has all the official Runtipi CLI features and the following ones:

- List app backups command (`./runtipi-cli app list-backups`)
- Healthcheck command using the worker API
- System readings from the worker API
- Backup command
- List backups command (for runtipi)
- Neofetch command (easter egg)
- Automatic backup of the CLI before update
- Increased timeout on app commands to 5 and 15 minutes (for updates) to make sure it is the same as the dashboard timeout

### Installation

To install the CLI you need to follow 4 simple steps.

1. Download the latest version matching your system's arch from the [releases](https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi-cli-go/releases/) page.
2. Put the CLI in your `runtipi` folder and rename it to `runtipi-cli-go`.
3. Make it executable `chmod +x runtipi-cli-go`
4. Start using it `sudo ./runtipi-cli-go start`

### Building

To build the CLI you need to have go installed and then run these commands:

Firstly clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi-cli-go
cd runtipi-cli-go/
```

Install packages:

```bash
go get .
```

Build:

```bash
go build
```

> Note üóíÔ∏è: You can get the CLI down to around 8mb using the `go build -ldflags '-w -s'` command.

You should have the CLI named `runtipi-cli-go`.
